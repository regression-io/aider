## Install git

Make sure you have git installed.
Here are
[instructions for installing git in various environments](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git).

## Get your API key

To work with OpenAI's GPT 3.5 or GPT-4 models you need a paid
[OpenAI API key](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key).
Note that this is different than being a "ChatGPT Plus" subscriber.

To work with Anthropic's models like Claude 3 Opus you need a paid
[Anthropic API key](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/getting-started-with-the-api).

## Manage your python environment

Using a Python 
[virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
is recommended.
Or, you could consider 
[installing aider using pipx](/docs/install/pipx.html).

## Windows install

```
# Install aider
py -m pip install aider-chat

# To work with GPT-4o:
$ aider --openai-api-key sk-xxx...

# To work with Claude 3 Opus:
$ aider --anthropic-api-key sk-xxx... --opus
```

## Mac/Linux install

```
# Install aider
python -m pip install aider-chat

# To work with GPT-4o:
$ aider --openai-api-key sk-xxx...

# To work with Claude 3 Opus:
$ aider --anthropic-api-key sk-xxx... --opus
```

## Working with other LLMs

Aider works well with GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus, GPT-3.5 and supports [connecting to almost any LLM](https://aider.chat/docs/llms.html).

## You are done!
