Aider has special support for providing
OpenAI and Anthropic API keys
via command line switches and yaml config settings.
*All other LLM providers* must 
have their keys and settings 
specified in environment variables.
This can be done in your shell, 
or by using a 
[`.env` file](/docs/dotenv.html).
